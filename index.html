                    <p id="aboutme">Greetings, I'm Michael Chiem. My journey in the United States began at the age of fourteen in 1992, and at that time, my grasp of English was non-existent. In 1994, I moved to Utah to enroll at <a href="https://clearfield.jobcorps.gov/">CJCC.gov</a> in Clearfield, where over the next four years, I earned my high school diploma as well as certifications in Welding and Autobody trade.

                        Following my academic pursuits, I embarked on a professional path as a welder and painter at Lagoon for a few years. Subsequently, I transitioned to a prominent construction company in West Jordan, where I worked as a welder and fitter. Concurrently, I pursued computer science at Provo College and graduated in 1999, spurred on by the unwavering support and motivation provided by my wife.
                        
                        Driven by a desire to enhance my skill set, I enrolled in Utes bootcamp, aspiring to gain an additional layer of expertise that would set me apart when seeking employment opportunities. My aim is to continually improve and expand my capabilities, ensuring a competitive edge in the job market. I anticipate acquiring valuable insights during this course and relishing the challenges it presents.
                        
                        Presently, I find myself both nervous and frustrated, reflecting on the time I feel I may have wasted in the past five years. However, I am committed to learning from this experience and have made a personal pledge to persist in my educational pursuits until retirement. I appreciate your evaluation of my progress and thank you for your guidance.
